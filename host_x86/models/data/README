Please download some images from the ImageNet 2012 training dataset as calibration images for decent. 
100 - 1000 images should be OK.
A calibration txt file is also needed which lists the filename of each calibration images and its class number.
For the pathes of calibration images and txt file, please refer to the float.prototxt of Resnet50. 
You can also modify the pathes in float.protoxt based on where you put the calibration iamges and txt file in the host machine.
For more details, please refer to the chapter 5 of UG1327.
